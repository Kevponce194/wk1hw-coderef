## week 1 homework - Code Refactor

**Assignment:** Take existing Code and refactor

**Tasks:**

- [X] HTML is semantically correct
- [X] A logical flow of html elements
- [x] All links are workng
- [x] Title is logical
- [X] Images have alt tags (except image in CSS)
- [X] CSS selectors and properties are efficient

(image in css selector .group-photo needs an alt tag, but it is my understanding, so far, that screen readers do not read an alt tag from a css file, so I still need to research that.)

**Additional considerations:**

- [x] Provide links to Github repo and Github pages
    * **wk1hw repo:** https://github.com/Kevponce194/wk1hw-coderef
    * **GitHub Pages:** https://kevponce194.github.io/wk1hw-coderef
- [x] Continue git command line executions

**Additional enhancements:**
* add a:hover color to navigation
